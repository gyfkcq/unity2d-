# unity2d-我的第一个游戏
## 2024.10.14
工程项目实训课程中的unity让我感觉很有意思，可惜没有底子，简单看了下b站感觉想要完成对应的任务还是有点难度，再加上正在考研。但是不妨一试，把unity下载了，尝试了一下，最终发现完成该项目作业的时间成本预计1-2周的完整时间，遂放弃。

打算开始学习unity，从2d开始，目标是做一个demo，把原本休闲打游戏的时间用来学习unity，感觉非常的充实。原本打游戏消磨时间后都会不舒服，换成学习开发小游戏，确实给了很多正反馈和充实感。
## 2024.11.13
经过两周多课余时间的努力，完成了一个demo，剩下的就是做一些优化了。

目前已经完成的：
角色的动作和动画：休息、跑、跳、二段跳、爬墙、受伤击退、死亡与复活
关卡的设计：地图、水果（金币）、蘑菇怪、地刺陷阱、圆形滚刺陷阱、弹簧平台
UI界面：开始按钮、选关界面、更换角色皮肤界面、结束游戏界面
相机跟随

目前待完成：
死亡后相机无法继续跟随复活的角色
声音系统
其他小怪和Boss设计

## 2024.11.16
声音系统已经完成，暂停UI设计完毕。

目前待完成清单：
手机端按钮

# Unity2D - My First Game
## October 14, 2024
The Unity course in the project training program was interesting, but I had no prior knowledge, so I briefly looked at Bilibili and felt that it would be difficult to complete the corresponding tasks. Plus, I was preparing for the national college entrance examination. However, I decided to give it a try and downloaded Unity to try it out. In the end, I found that the estimated time cost for completing the project assignment was 1-2 weeks, so I decided to give up. 

## On October 26, 2024
I plan to start learning Unity from 2D, with the goal of creating a demo. I will use the time I used to play casual games to learn Unity, which feels very fulfilling. After wasting time playing games, I would always feel uncomfortable, but switching to learning to develop small games has given me a lot of positive feedback and a sense of fulfillment. 

## On November 13, 2024
After more than two weeks of after-class effort, a demo was completed, and the rest is to make some optimizations. 

What has been completed so far:
Character actions and animations: idle, run, jump, double jump, wall climbing, injured knockback, death and resurrection
Level design: maps, fruit (coins), mushroom monsters, spike traps, circular rolling spike traps, spring platforms
UI interface: start button, select level screen, character skin change screen, end-of-game screen
Camera following 

Currently in progress:
Camera cannot continue following resurrected characters after death
Sound system
Design for other minions and Bosses 

## 2024.11.16
The audio system has been completed, and the UI design has been paused. 

Current to-do list:
Mobile button
